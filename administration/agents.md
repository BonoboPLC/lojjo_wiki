# Creating Sales Agents
![Contact](/uploads/contact.png "Contact"){:height="100px" width="100px"}

Sales Agents can be anyone of your staff, an external sales representative or volunteer. 

Sales Agents can use any device, like a smartphone, tablet or PC to sell tickets, pay winnings and much more.

Sales Agents can operate from call centers, door to door or from retail storefronts.

Follow the 2 easy steps shown below to create an account for a Sales Agent

> Step 1.  Navigate to the Sales Agent tab shown on the navigation
{.is-info}

![Sales Agent Tab](/uploads/sales-agent-tab.png "Sales Agent Tab")

> Step 2 Select "Create New Agent" from the top right hand navigation
{.is-info}

![Create Agent](/uploads/create-agent.png "Create Agent")

You will now be taken to the **Sales Agent Create Wizard**

## Set username/pw
 In the first step of the **Sales Agent Create Wizard** you'll need to set a username and temporary password for your Sales Agent.
 
 The agent will receive the credentials via email and will be prompted to change their password on their first log in.

## Set Agent details

You will then be asked to complete a few personal details such as Name, and Birthdate.

Make sure that the personal details such as birthdate are accurate so that you can be sure your Sales Agents are of legal age.

## Set Store address

If your agent operates out of a different physical address than your location, please enter it here.

This store address will be listed on the web site and used for referrals by other Sales Agents.

## Setting Sales & Deposit Limits

You can set limits on how much sales or deposit receipts an agent can have on hand. 

This limit helps you avoid mishaps and protect you and the sales agent against any losses.

Once the limits are reached the Sales Agent must remit any sales and deposit limits to their Manager before selling additional Tickets.

**Sales Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount of Sales Receipts your agent can have on hand; effectively how much Tickets they can sell.
Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to [remit the Sales Receipts](/administration/agents#collecting-sales-receipts) to their manager, before being able to sell again.

**Deposit Receipt Limit**
This is the maximum amount of Deposit Receipts your agent can have on hand. This is used by players to simply add money to their account and is not due to a Ticket purchase.
Once this limit is reached the Sales Agent will need to [remit the Deposit Receipts](/administration/agents#collecting-deposit-receipts) to their manager, before being able to accept Deposits again.

You can limit the prizes that agent is able to pay.
**Prize Payout Limit**
This is the maximum amount that this Agent can payout in prizes to players

![Set Commissions](/uploads/set-commissions.png "Set Commissions")
## Setting Agent Commissions
You can set  a  **Commission Percentage** for each Sales Agent.

This is the Percentage that the Sales Agent earns from each Ticket Sale, calculated as a % of the Rake (Gross Profits) of each ticket sold. I.e. 

Assuming a $100 entry into a 50/50 game, where $50 is the Rake on each ticket, a 10% commission to the agent would net the Sales Agent a $5 Commission.

The Sales Agent can see how much they would earn for each ticket, in the game selection menu of the Sales Agent App as shown below.

## Enabling Agents to Pay Prizes

By default all Sales Agents are not able to process payouts.  

This helps you avoid mishaps and designate which Sales Agents can process payouts, and their respective limitations. 

To enable a Sales Agent to pay prizes, please follow the 3 easy steps shown below.


> Set Agent Prize Payout Limit
{.is-info}

This **Prize Payout Limit** is  the maximum value that can be paid by this Sales Agent. 

An agent cannot pay an amount exceeding this limit on any prize payouts.  To disable payouts entirely for this agent, leave this limit at zero.

You can use this to allow most agents to make small payouts, but reserve larger payouts for a select few trusted Sales Agents.


![Agent Prize Payout Limit](/uploads/agent-prize-payout-limit.png "Agent Prize Payout Limit")

> Ensure they have sufficient Withdrawl Float
{.is-info}

Ensure the player has sufficient balance in the [Withdrawal Float](/administration/agents#managing-withdrawal-float)



![Withdrawal Float Agent 2](/uploads/withdrawal-float-agent-2.png "Withdrawal Float Agent 2")


> Enable agent to payout from Sales Receipt
{.is-info}

This step is optional, but very useful in helping an agent recycle the funds from Ticket Sales into Prize Payouts.

For example if  the Sales Agent has $1,000  in Ticket Sales for the day, but you did not provide them with a Withdrawal Float in the beginning of the day, the Agent can use money from Ticket Sales to pay prizes.

You can disable or enable this setting based on your requirements.

![Agent Activity Tracker](/uploads/agent-activity-tracker.png "Agent Activity Tracker")


## Managing Withdrawal Float

Every Sales Agent has a Withdrawal Float Account in the system which is used for Paying Prizes.

This account tracks any funds which are provided to the Agent, by head office, for the purpose of paying expected Player prizes during normal course of business.

This **account is increased** when the Sales manager funds the account to pay for expected prize payouts.

This **account is decreased** when the Sales Agent uses the funds to pay Player prizes or remits the remaining amount back to the Sales Manager.

>If allowed to Pay Prizes from Sales Receipts and the Agent doesn't have sufficient funds in the Withdrawal Float to pay a winning ticket, but has enough cash from the days sales receipt, the Agent can use [Sales Reciepts to Pay Prizes](/retail-sales-agents#paying-prizes).
{.is-warning}

>If the Agent cannot pay prizes, they will ask the player to return and attempt to contact the Manager for more funds for their Withdrawal Float account in order to pay the player. 
{.is-warning}

>If the Agent cannot pay for whatever reason, an alert will be shown in the Agent Activity. The Agent will be provided with a list of alternatives to present to the player for prize retrieval.
{.is-danger}

## Collecting Sales Receipts

Every Sales Agent has a Sales Receipt Account in the system which tracks the money from Ticket Sales.

This account increases each time a payment is made to the Sales Agent and only decreases when the Sales Receipts are remitted to the Sales Manager.

![Sales Receipts Collec 2 T](/uploads/sales-receipts-collec-2-t.png "Sales Receipts Collec 2 T")

Typically at the end of the day you would ask the Agent to remit all Sales Receipts for the Day and record the transaction as shown below.

![Collect Sales Receipts](/uploads/collect-sales-receipts.png "Collect Sales Receipts")

## Collecting Deposit Receipts

Every Sales Agent has a Deposit Receipt Account in the system which tracks the money from Player Account Deposits. 

This account increases each time a payment is made to the Sales Agent by the Player and only decreases when the Deposit Receipts are remitted to the Sales Manager.

![Deposit Receipts Collect 2](/uploads/deposit-receipts-collect-2.png "Deposit Receipts Collect 2")

Typically at the end of the day you would ask the Agent to remit all Deposit Receipts for the Day and record the transaction. 

![Collect Deposit Receipts](/uploads/collect-deposit-receipts.png "Collect Deposit Receipts")


## Paying Agent Commissions

Every Sales Agent has a Commission Account in the system which tracks the oustanding Commissions payable. 

If you have set a commission rate for your Sales Agent, then payable commissions will be reflected after each Ticket Sale.

This account increases each time a commission is earned on Ticket Sales and only decreases when the Sales Agent is paid.


![Pay Agent Comm 3](/uploads/pay-agent-comm-3.png "Pay Agent Comm 3")

When payment is made at each pay period, record the transaction here.
